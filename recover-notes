Notes for Recover

jpegs are stored back to back
all jpegs begins with the same bits

open card.raw
read in bytes from card.raw
- and if bytes = the particular jpeg bits then we have found the header

if we found the first jpeg file, do something
{
found first jpeg
read in the bytes into new file


}

 else close it 
 
 else if continue reading
 
 since we fopened we need to close everything at the end, no memory leaks either
