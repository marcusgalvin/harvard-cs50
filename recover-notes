Notes for Recover

jpegs are stored back to back
all jpegs begins with the same , header

open card.raw
read in bytes from card.raw
- and if bytes = the particular jpeg bits then we have found the header

if we found the first jpeg file, do something
{
found first jpeg
read in the bytes into new file


}

 else close it

 else if continue reading

 since we fopened we need to close everything at the end, no memory leaks either


if JPEG found use sprintf
then fopen

then fwrite(data, size, number, outptr) outptr is new image we create

then we have to stop reading
